Wecome to my first Fullstack application: Revision-Card-Appication! 

The goal of this project is to apply my skills in both thee frontend and backend. 
This application will hopefully utilise the majority of skills I've learnt over the last 5 months. 

Dry, organise and bug free TS is the end goal of this project! 

Once the application is fully functioning, I will hopefuly add more features to the application, such as:  JWT, Authentication and users. 

These added feaures will hopefuly further consolidate my acquired skills. 

Enjoy the application and feedback is welcome as awlways!
